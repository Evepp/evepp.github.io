An alarming increase of interest in beinga a Doctor has been always aligned in many cultures, it is the case as well of Ecuador. In this we can see the alarming unemployability that those may get as well, 

This projects aims to answer the following questions: 
- What are the current (2024) and future societal needs of Ecuadorian society?
- What cultural shifts are preventing students to identify their niche?
- Which preconceptions of career perspectives may they have? 
- How can we identify the talents and interests of high school and university students in specific areas?




This project aligns with my volunteering work teaching online in high schools and universities in Ecuador.
