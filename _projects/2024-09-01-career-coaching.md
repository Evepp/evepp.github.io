This project aligns with my volunteering work, where I teach in high schools and universities in Ecuador online mode.

An increasing interest in becoming a doctor has been prevalent in many cultures, and this is also true in Ecuador. However, there is an alarming issue of unemployability in this field due to oversaturation in certain areas such as medicine and law ([Rosero,2024](https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/preocupa-sobrepoblacion-medicos-generales-ecuador-doble-necesario-107964.html)). While certain fields like  medicine may seem to offer high reputation or salary, in reality, some areas are not as in demand, which could divert students from achieving success in other potential fields, in which in fact they were more inclained from the beginning. 

This project aims to answer the following questions:

- What are the current (2024) and future societal needs of Ecuadorian society?
- What cultural shifts are preventing students from identifying their niche?
- What misconceptions do students have about career prospects?
- How can we better identify the talents and interests of high school and university students in specific areas?

Methods: 
- Case Studies for in-depth interviews with students, educators, and industry professionals
- Data analysis of the economic market.
- Workshops or Seminars for students to explore different career paths. 

Current state:
- Worshops for students to develop a network in which can be set potential interviews and focus interviews.
- Data Analysis with dashboards for presentations. 

  
Priorities: 
- Cleaning databases from the Economic Ministry.
