An increasing interest in becoming a doctor has been prevalent in many cultures, and this is also true in Ecuador. However, there is an alarming issue of unemployability in this field due to oversaturation in certain areas such as medicine and law ([Rosero,2024](https://www.extra.ec/noticia/actualidad/preocupa-sobrepoblacion-medicos-generales-ecuador-doble-necesario-107964.html)). While medicine may seem to offer high reputation or salary, in reality, some areas are not as in demand, which could divert students from achieving success in other potential fields. 

This project aims to answer the following questions:

- What are the current (2024) and future societal needs of Ecuadorian society?
- What cultural shifts are preventing students from identifying their niche?
- What misconceptions do students have about career prospects?
- How can we better identify the talents and interests of high school and university students in specific areas?

This project aligns with my volunteering work, where I teach online in high schools and universities in Ecuador.
