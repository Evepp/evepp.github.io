In September 1848, Vermont. An accident ocurred and was a case that would become a cornerstone in the analysis of behavior: the remarkable story of Phineas Gage.

The Incident: Gage, a railroad construction foreman, survived a severe accident when an iron rod was accidentally driven through his skull. 
Despite recovering physically with his intellectual capacities and senses intact, the accident had profound effects on his behavior.

- Before the Accident: Gage was known for being the most efficient and capable man in his field.
- After the Accident: His personality changed drastically. He became fitful, irreverent, and showed little regard for his peers.

This case highlighted how damage to the brain can profoundly impact who we are and how we behave. 
So, the question came
#### How much our brain dictates our personality or is it Mind=Brain? 

A 20th Century Perspective: In 1994, Francis Crick’s “The Astonishing Hypothesis” proposed a materialistic view: a person's mental activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make them up and influence them. This perspective underscores a materialistic approach to understanding the mind.

Let's revisit Phineas Gage Case!
Is Gage’s case a conclusive argument that Mind=Brain? This requires further exploration. While the brain undeniably plays a crucial role, I will suggest that the mind encompasses more than just the brain. Twelve years after his injury, Gage developed epilepsy and eventually died, do we know that he was completly recovered? that his capacities trutly came the same? In 1848, his doctor...

Our understanding of the mind should consider more than just cortical damage!
Traumatic events can influence not only the brain but also introspective and emotional aspects. The path of psychology has increasingly favored empirical approaches, 
but are we neglecting non-materialistic dimensions of the mind due to a lack of tools? 
Qualitative methods have mapped aspects of self-awareness, thought, and perception, yet there remains a need to explore even more.

A Broader Perspective: 
As an economist, I observe that schools and systems often rely on empirical experiments that can be proven. As a data analyst, I recognize the value of numerical perspectives. However, as a social and behavioral science researcher, I am committed to understanding the complex facets of self-awareness, introspection, and consciousness—dimensions that may be overlooked when focusing solely on quantifiable data.

Takeaways: 
- Phineas Gage’s case serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate relationship between the brain and the mind.
- While empirical methods provide valuable insights, a comprehensive understanding of the human psyche requires integrating both materialistic and introspective approaches.
