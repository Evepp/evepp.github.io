In September 1848, an accident in Vermont involving Phineas Gage, a railroad construction foreman, became a key case in behavior analysis.

The Incident: An iron rod accidentally pierced Gage's skull. Although he physically recovered and retained his intellectual abilities, his behavior changed dramatically.

    Before the Accident: Gage was highly efficient and respected.
    After the Accident: He became impulsive, disrespectful, and indifferent to others.

This case raised the question: How much does the brain influence personality? Is it Mind = Brain?

20th Century Perspective: In 1994, Francis Crick proposed that all mental activities result from nerve and glial cells. This materialistic view emphasizes the brain's role in the mind.

Returning to Gage’s case, while it suggests that the brain is vital, it may not be the entire story. Twelve years post-accident, Gage developed epilepsy and eventually died. Did he truly recover?

Our understanding of the mind should go beyond brain damage. Trauma can affect emotional and introspective aspects as well. Materialism often prioritizes empirical methods, but we may overlook non-materialistic dimensions of the mind.

A Broader Perspective: As an economist and data analyst, I value empirical data. However, as a researcher in cognitive sciences, I aim to explore the complexities of self-awareness and consciousness that quantifiable data might miss. We may need a 360 vision. 

Takeaways:

    Phineas Gage’s case highlights the complex relationship between the brain and the mind.
    A full understanding of human psychology requires both empirical and introspective approaches.
